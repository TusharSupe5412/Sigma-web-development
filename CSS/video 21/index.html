        The order of specificity is:
        <h2>
          Inline Style > ID Selector > Class or Attribute Selector > Element
          Selector > Universal Selector

      <h1>The Cascade Algorithm :</h1>
      <p>
        CSS stands for Cascading Stylesheets. The cascade is the algorithm for
        solving conflicts where multiple CSS rules apply to an HTML element.
        It's the reason that the text of the button styled with the above CSS
        will be purple. Understanding the cascade algorithm helps you understand
        how the browser resolves conflicts like this. The cascade algorithm has
        4 distinct stages.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Position and order of appearance: the order in which your CSS rules
          appear
        </li>
        <li>
          Specificity: an algorithm that determines which CSS selector has the
          strongest match
        </li>
        <li>
          Origin: the order in which CSS appears and where it comes from,
          whether that is a browser style, CSS from a browser extension, or your
          authored CSS
        </li>
        <li>
          Importance: some CSS rules are weighted more heavily than others,
          especially with the !important rule type Lets look into all these one
          by one
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h1>Specificity Calculation :</h1>
      <p>
        To calculate specificity, assign a value to each part of the selector:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Universal Selector: 0</li>
        <li>Element selectors and pseudo-elements: 1</li>
        <li>Class selectors, attribute selectors, and pseudo-classes: 10</li>
        <li>ID selectors: 100</li>
        <li>Inline styles: 1000</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </body>
